        today a game i've been waiting for for a while came out, studio system: guardian angel!!<br><br>

        i've played it for a couple hours, and so far it's pretty good!! i really don't understand what's going on but i think it's supposed to be that was, and also i'm pretty stupid so it does make sense.<br><br> 

        so far i'm at the puzzle with the switched and the head and feet and hip and whatever. im kinda stuck though and checked the time and decided to write this blog instead :)<br><br>

        i have lots of things to look forward to this month! studio system (of course), ghostholding and i also have a lot of packages coming!! im getting an isopod plush soon and also a cassette. i will show you when they arrive!! (if images work on here)<br><br>

        next month i will play psycho patrol r which will also probabl be pretty great. it's a shame it's so much money but ville did just say pirate it so that'll probably be how i play if unless someone gets it for me. even with permission to pirate though i don't usually pirate early access games because they aren't updated on piracy sites as often as i would like.<br><br>

        anyways that's all for first real blog post hahaaaaa <br><br>
